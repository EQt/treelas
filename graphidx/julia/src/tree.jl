A rooted tree represanted by its parent vector, i.e. if `u` is the parent node of `v` then `parent[v] == u`.
We always require that root is its own parent (`parent[root] == root`) and `length(parent) == n`.

Often you might want to have a [`ChildrenIndex`](@ref).
For debugging, the [`hierarchy`](@ref) function might be useful.
